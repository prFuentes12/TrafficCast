# TrafficCast

## Project Overview

TrafficCast is a traffic forecasting system that predicts traffic flow and congestion patterns using machine learning techniques. It aims to help users anticipate traffic conditions based on historical data, weather conditions, and various other factors that influence traffic patterns. This project is designed to provide insights into traffic forecasting and demonstrate how data-driven approaches can improve transportation planning and decision-making.

## Features

- Predicts traffic congestion levels based on historical traffic data.
- Integrates external data sources such as weather conditions, time of day, and special events.
- Implements machine learning models to improve the accuracy of traffic predictions.
  
## Technologies Used

- Python (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn)
- Machine Learning (Regression Models, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Git and GitHub (version control)
- Data from public traffic databases

## Steps Followed

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Collected historical traffic data from public sources.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing the data.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Added features such as weather conditions, time of day, and events in the area to improve the accuracy of predictions.
   - Performed feature scaling to ensure that the model could effectively use all features.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Trained multiple machine learning models, including regression algorithms and decision trees, to predict traffic congestion.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to determine the best-performing model.
   - Fine-tuned the model parameters to improve performance.

## Results and Performance

### Top 5 Most Important Features

The following features were found to have the most significant impact on the model's predictions:

| Feature      | Importance |
|--------------|------------|
| **hour**     | 0.824749   |
| **dayofweek**| 0.066486   |
| **is_weekend**| 0.041508  |
| **temperature**| 0.012618 |
| **day**      | 0.012283   |

### Training Set Performance:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 23,709.07  
  The MSE for the training set is relatively low, indicating that the model's predictions are close to the actual values.
  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 153.98  
  The RMSE value suggests that the average prediction error is approximately 154 units, which is acceptable for the training set.
  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 84.71  
  The MAE value indicates that the model's average error on the training set is around 85 units.

- **R-squared (R²):** 0.9940  
  The R² value shows that the model explains approximately 99.4% of the variance in the traffic data for the training set, which suggests a highly accurate model.

### Validation Set Performance:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 165,320.55  
  The MSE for the validation set is higher, indicating that the model's performance decreases when predicting on unseen data.
  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 406.60  
  The RMSE for the validation set is significantly higher than the training set, suggesting the model's predictions on new data are less accurate.
  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 223.56  
  The MAE for the validation set is also higher, showing that the model's error on the validation data is greater than on the training data.

- **R-squared (R²):** 0.9586  
  The R² for the validation set is still high at 95.86%, but it is lower than the training set, indicating that the model does not generalize quite as well to unseen data.

### Model Insights:

- The **hour** of the day was identified as the most important feature, having the highest impact on traffic congestion predictions.
- External factors such as **temperature**, **day of the week**, and **whether it's the weekend** also play a role, though their impact is less significant compared to time-based features like the **hour**.

### Model Evaluation Summary:

- The model performs very well on the training set with an **R²** of 0.994, but its performance drops slightly on the validation set, with an **R²** of 0.958.
- The **MSE** and **RMSE** values for the validation set indicate that while the model is still quite good, it may benefit from additional fine-tuning, further data exploration, or more complex algorithms to improve generalization.

## Conclusion

TrafficCast demonstrates the power of machine learning in traffic prediction and congestion management. By leveraging historical data and external features, such as weather and special events, the model can offer highly accurate predictions of traffic congestion. This can help both drivers and city planners make informed decisions.

The project also highlights the importance of feature engineering, as adding context-rich data like weather and event schedules significantly improved prediction accuracy. Future improvements may involve experimenting with more advanced machine learning models, including deep learning algorithms, and integrating real-time data sources for up-to-the-minute predictions.
